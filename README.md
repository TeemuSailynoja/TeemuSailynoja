## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Teemu

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist specialising in probabilistic modelling, uncertainty quantification, and data visualization.

Currently, Iâ€™m finishing up my doctorate at the Probabilistic Machine Learning Group of Aalto University. My research interests lie in the workflow of Bayesian modelling, and I focus in calibration assessments and visual predictive checking.
